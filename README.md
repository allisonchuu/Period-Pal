# Period-Pal

Welcome to your very own Period Pal!

Period Pal is a tamogatchi-like menstrual cycle care-taking app that has a representation of yourself that helps you learn more about the way your body is affected by hormone changes by feeding yourself, exercising, sleeping on time and watching your little person go through their cycle along with you. It uses research about health and the menstrual cycle to guide the game mechanics so that it will educate the player about a usually taboo topic while making it fun and promoting self-care!
